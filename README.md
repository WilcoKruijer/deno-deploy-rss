# Deploy RSS Reader


This is a very simple RSS reader made for [Deno Deploy](http://deno.com/deploy/). Because of a bug in the Deno runtime (?) the code currently does not run with `--no-check`. The Deploy runtime automatically runs with `--no-check`, thus this does not work in production. Checkout the ['bug' document](bug/bug.md) for a more eleborate description.
